Trace Claude Code sessions with CoreWeave Forge AgentLens for observability and debugging. Every session, turn, tool call, and subagent is logged as a structured trace, with no code changes required.

## Quick Start

**1. Install the CLI**

```bash
npm install -g @coreweave/forge-claude-code
```

**2. Run the installer**

```bash
forge-claude-code install
```

This will:
- Create `~/.forge-claude-code/settings.json`
- Register the plugin in Claude Code
- Prompt for your Forge project (`entity/project`) and W&B API key if not already set

Your W&B API key is available at https://wandb.ai/authorize.

For CI, bootstrap scripts, or other automated systems, you can skip prompts:

```bash
FORGE_TRACE_PROJECT=my-entity/my-project \
WANDB_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
forge-claude-code install --non-interactive
```

In non-interactive mode, the installer still creates config, registers the Claude marketplace, and installs the plugin. It does not prompt for missing values. Instead, it:
- Uses `FORGE_TRACE_PROJECT` and `WANDB_API_KEY` from the environment when present
- Warns and continues if either value is missing
- Leaves environment-provided values in the environment rather than writing them into `settings.json`

By default, Claude Code clones `wandb/forge-claude-code` from GitHub. In CI or container sandboxes without git/SSH access to GitHub, pass `--source=local` to install the marketplace and plugin from the npm-installed tree on disk instead:

```bash
npm install -g @coreweave/forge-claude-code
forge-claude-code install --non-interactive --source=local
```

`--source=local` requires the package to be installed globally via npm first (it reads from `$(npm root -g)/@coreweave/forge-claude-code`). Upgrades follow the npm cadence; the marketplace ref drift check is skipped for local sources.

**3. Restart or launch Claude Code**

If Claude Code is already running, reload plugins from inside the session:

```
/reload-plugins
```

Otherwise, launch Claude Code from any folder:

```bash
claude
```

Sessions are traced automatically from this point, across **all** Claude Code sessions on this machine. Tracing is not scoped to a single Claude Code project. To stop tracing, run `forge-claude-code uninstall`.

Open your Forge project in CoreWeave Forge AgentLens to see them.

## Data Disclosure

This plugin sends Claude Code session data to CoreWeave Forge AgentLens.

That data can include sensitive content, including:
- user prompts
- Claude responses
- tool inputs
- tool outputs
- file paths and file contents read by Claude Code tools
- shell commands and shell output
- fetched URLs and fetched page content

If Claude Code accesses secrets, credentials, proprietary source code, personal
data, or other confidential material during a session, that information may be
logged to CoreWeave Forge AgentLens as part of the trace.

PII scrubbing and sensitive-data redaction are **not yet implemented** in the
current version. If you cannot send this data to CoreWeave Forge AgentLens under your security
or compliance requirements, do not install or enable this plugin yet.

---

## Configuration

```bash
# Show all current settings (env-var overrides are flagged in the output)
forge-claude-code config show

# Read a single setting (resolves env-var overrides)
forge-claude-code config get project

# Set your Forge project
forge-claude-code config set project my-entity/my-project

# Set your W&B API key
forge-claude-code config set wandb_api_key <your-api-key>

# (Optional) Customize the agent name shown in CoreWeave Forge AgentLens (default: claude-code)
forge-claude-code config set agent_name my-team-bot
```

You can also set these via environment variables — they take precedence over the settings file:

```bash
export FORGE_TRACE_PROJECT=my-entity/my-project
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export FORGE_CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_NAME=my-team-bot
```

This is especially useful with `forge-claude-code install --non-interactive`, where the installer checks these variables instead of prompting.

---

## Check Status

```bash
forge-claude-code status
```

Each line shows `✓` (OK), `✗` (action needed), or `-` (not yet active but not an error).

If sessions are not appearing in CoreWeave Forge AgentLens, check the daemon log for errors:

```bash
forge-claude-code logs              # last 50 lines (default)
forge-claude-code logs --tail 200   # last N lines
forge-claude-code logs --follow     # tail -f
```

The log file is also directly at `~/.forge-claude-code/logs/daemon.log`.

For more verbose daemon output while diagnosing an issue, enable debug mode:

```bash
forge-claude-code config set debug true
# or, just for the current shell session:
export FORGE_CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG=1
```

---

## Skills

Once the plugin is installed, three skills are available directly inside any Claude Code session. They use a `/forge:forge-*` naming pattern (rather than the shorter `/forge:install` form) to avoid colliding with Claude Code's built-in skills.

### `/forge:forge-install`

Walks through the full installation and configuration flow interactively. Use this on a fresh machine or to diagnose a broken setup. Claude will check for the CLI, run the installer, prompt for missing config values, and verify everything is working.

```
/forge:forge-install
```

### `/forge:forge-status`

Checks the current plugin status and explains any issues. Equivalent to running `forge-claude-code status` but Claude interprets the output and tells you exactly what to fix.

```
/forge:forge-status
```

### `/forge:forge-config`

Read or update plugin configuration without leaving Claude Code.

```
# Show current config
/forge:forge-config

# Set a value directly
/forge:forge-config set project my-entity/my-project
/forge:forge-config set wandb_api_key <your-api-key>
```

## What Gets Traced

The plugin emits OTel spans that follow the [GenAI semantic
conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai) and ships
them to the CoreWeave Forge AgentLens observability backend (`/agents/otel/v1/traces`).
Each user prompt produces one OTel trace (the "turn"); multi-turn
conversations are stitched together server-side via
`gen_ai.conversation.id`, which is set to the Claude Code session id on
every span in the turn.

Spans are built with the [CoreWeave Forge SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coreweave/forge-sdk).
Every span carries the `forge.integration.*` identity of this plugin; the
OTLP resource reports `service.name = forge-claude-code` and
`wandb.sdk.name = forge`.

```
invoke_agent claude-code                  (root — one trace per user prompt)
├─ chat <model>                           (each LLM API call within the turn)
├─ execute_tool <tool_name>               (each tool call: Read, Bash, Grep, ...)
└─ invoke_agent <subagent_type>           (subagent dispatched via the `Agent` tool)
   ├─ chat <model>                        (subagent LLM calls)
   └─ execute_tool <tool_name>            (tools the subagent ran)
```

Subagents (dispatched via Claude Code's `Agent` tool) are emitted as their
own nested `invoke_agent` span — a direct child of the turn span, sibling
of any regular tool calls — not as an `execute_tool Agent` span. This
matches the CoreWeave Forge AgentLens chat view's reference structure, where nested
`invoke_agent` spans render as an `agent_start` lifecycle marker for the
subagent. The spawning tool_use_id is preserved on the inner
`invoke_agent` span as `forge.claude_code.subagent.spawning_tool_call_id`.

Permission requests appear as `forge.permission_request` events on the
corresponding tool or agent call span; context-window compaction is recorded as
`weave.compaction.{summary,items_before,items_after}` attributes on the
turn span open at compaction time (or the next turn if compaction fires
between turns).

Each span includes per-call token usage (`gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`,
`gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, cache and reasoning token counts), model name
(`gen_ai.request.model`), tool inputs and outputs
(`gen_ai.tool.call.arguments`, `gen_ai.tool.call.result`), timing, and the
textual content of prompts and assistant messages
(`gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`).

Important: tool inputs and outputs may contain sensitive information. In
practice this can include file contents, command output, URLs, fetched content,
and other data handled by Claude Code during a session. That information is sent
to CoreWeave Forge AgentLens. PII scrubbing/redaction is planned for a future release, but is
not available today.

## Uninstall

```bash
forge-claude-code uninstall
```

Pass `--keep-logs` to preserve the log directory.

---

## Dedicated and On-Prem Instances

Only needed for W&B Dedicated Cloud or a self-hosted instance. On SaaS, traces go to `https://trace.wandb.ai` with no setup.

Set `WANDB_BASE_URL` to your deployment before launching Claude Code:

```bash
export WANDB_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.wandb.io
```

Traces then go to its trace server at `https://your-instance.wandb.io/traces`. Setting `WANDB_BASE_URL` to the SaaS API host, `https://api.wandb.ai`, still sends traces to `https://trace.wandb.ai`.

To use a different trace server, set `FORGE_TRACE_BASE_URL` to its URL. It takes precedence over `WF_TRACE_SERVER_URL`, which takes precedence over `WANDB_BASE_URL`.

The daemon reads these variables once, at startup. If it is already running, set them and restart it from the same shell:

```bash
export WANDB_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.wandb.io
forge-claude-code restart
```

---

## Releasing

The release workflow publishes to npm. GitHub marketplace installs use a
specific release tag rather than the repository default branch. New
releases are cut via two GitHub Actions:

1. **Version Bump** — dispatched with a version like `0.1.2`. Bumps the
   version across the repo and creates and pushes the matching `v0.1.2` tag.
2. **Publish Package** — dispatched with the tag (e.g. `v0.1.2`). Verifies
   the tag is consistent and not already published, then builds and
   publishes to npm.
